## â›“ Dependencies
`Piplcount` uses heavily [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) and was tested with OpenCV 3.3.0. Despite this dependency is added to `requirements.txt`, is **encouraged** to use a manually compiled version. This article from Manuel Ignacio LÃ³pez Quintero can help you: http://milq.github.io/install-opencv-ubuntu-debian/. It's important also to include the support for [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) when compiling OpenCV.
